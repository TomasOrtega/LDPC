# LDPC
This repository contains code that was developed for my master's thesis on LDPCs.
See [this MIT post](https://news.mit.edu/2010/gallager-codes-0121) for a nice article on the history of these codes.

This repository is meant mainly for replicability purposes - it is not organized very well.
All the code is original, except the functions to read and write ``.alist`` matrices, and the AR4JA folders.

## How to cite:

If you find something useful, please cite my master's thesis: T. Ortega, "[Low Density Parity Check codes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YElSNAIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)," Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, 2021.

## Main folders of interest

### gap_code

Contains ``incidence_matrix_GQ.gap``, the GAP script to obtain point-line incidence matrices of different GQs.

### graph_tests

Contains several functions that could be of interest. For example:
+ ``girth_of_H`` computes the girth of a binary code from a parity-check matrix.
+ ``H2adjacency`` converts a parity-check matrix to an adjacency matrix.
+ ``plot_Tanner_and_H`` plots the Tanner graph and parity-check matrix shape.

### matlab_codes
+ ``BIAWGN_capacity`` numerically accurate BI-AWGN capacity calculator.
+ ``generate_regular_H`` generates a random regular parity-check matrix.
+ ``systematic_form`` transforms a parity-check matrix to systematic (or standard) form, with the convention H = [I P].
